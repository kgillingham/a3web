        <h4>Kate</h4>
        <p class="biotext">Kate has an MSc from Carleton University and thinks that geology is the schist. Her favourite mineral is Halite because she too is a bit
          salty. Kate spent 11 days in the desert, collecting 50 rocks for a 300 page thesis which would take her 2.5 years and one
          dangerous lab accident to complete. She is now pursuing a career in GIS to distance herself from deadly chemicals and to instead
          spend all of her time sitting behind a computer. Just like Carbon, Kate shines under pressure. 
          When Kate grows up she hopes to become a GIS Applications Specialist.</p>

        <h4>Mark</h4>
        <p class="biotext">Mark received a BSc in Wildlife Biology from the University of Guelph, and has surveyed birds in bogs, deserts, 
          mountains, and mudflats over the past 10 years. Bird really is the word, and when his study subjects fly south for the winter he's often 
          followed them, guiding tourists in the Neotropics. While the life of the nomad is great, living out of a backpack and not 
          showering only lasts so long, so now he's turned to GIS to analyze the type of data he loves to collect.

        <h4>Kazuto</h4>
        <p class="biotext">Kazuto received a BSc in geology from Queen's University and has 3 years of experience in the mineral exploration industry. 
          Recently he has discovered a passion for programming and GIS, mainly because you can avoid being eaten alive by blackflies if you are indoors.
          Likes: rock climbing, camping, piano, gaming, beer, and tea. Dislikes: raisin cookies, people pronouncing "gif" with a j sound, and stepping in a small 
          puddle of water on your kitchen floor and getting one sock wet. Awful experience. Wouldn't wish it on anyone.
